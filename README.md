# atext-slackemoji
 I found myself doing this `:bowtie:` in like every app, and well I was getting annoying that it didnt work outside of Slack, github etc etc etc so I spent sometime and made it in aText.

I have saved it here as both a `.atext` file and a `.csv`.

Thanks to [http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for all of the keyword bindings to emoji.
